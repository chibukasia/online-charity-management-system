# DESCRIPTION

We have come up with a professional website design that offers services to the charities and non-profit organizations in Kenya. Whether you have just started out or you run an established charity, RAISEIT - is a professional website design that helps charities and non-profit organizations develop an online presence and promote their business and services online to a wider audience of potential clients.We designed a fully functional charity website.Our web app has an admin, and users(whether an NGO or donor) that interact and make use of the page acording to their needs. An NGO can request to raise and fund its good cause through our web app and donors can support and fund the good causes through their donations and more through this web app.
We hope you enjoy using it and interacting with it as much as we enjoyed developing it. It is all in good faith and pride!!
